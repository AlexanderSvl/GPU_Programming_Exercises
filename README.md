1. Heat map project
     - This project integrates a simple heat map projection on the screen when the mouse is pressed. The longer the mouse stays at one place, the higher the intensity of the heat becomes.
     - I've used a CUDA kernel to simulate the heat dissipation algorithm and SDL for the application itself.
